### create a directory called "data" in the current directory and copy the train and test folder into it.


### CV_project_CCT+SIFT.ipynb:
Last Approach: train a convolutional vision transformer, and use SIFT to refine the predicted result. 
Note: generating and saving all images' descriptor will require a long running time.

### CV_project_regression.ipynb:
CNN from scratch and transfer learning.

### cell_classifier_trainer.ipynb:
train a cell classifier,
need to run the "cell Generator.py" first.

### cellGenerator: 
create partitions and generate "train_with_cells.csv"

### trainer: 
train a cell classifier

### cellClassifier: 
classifier models

### imageDirectory: 
create hierarchical image directory to fit the "flow_from_directory" function (deprecated)
